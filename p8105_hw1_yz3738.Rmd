This is my solution to HW1.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1

Create a data frame with specified elements.

```{r}
prob1_df = 
  tibble(
    samp = rnorm(10),
    samp_gt_0 = samp > 0,
    char_vec = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
    factor_vec = factor(c("low","mod","high","low","mod","high","low","mod","high","high"))
  )
```

Take the mean of each variable in my data frame.

```{r}
mean(pull(prob1_df, samp))
mean(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0))
mean(pull(prob1_df, char_vec))
mean(pull(prob1_df, factor_vec))
```
